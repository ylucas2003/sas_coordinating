# Quiz Statistics API

API for accessing quiz submission statistics. The statistics provided by this interface are an aggregate of what is known as Student and Item Analysis for a quiz.

These statistics are extracted (and composed) from *graded* (manually or, when viable, automatically) submissions for a quiz and provide an insight into how the participant students had responded to each question, as well as insights into the reception of each question answer individually.

Some of these statistics are exclusive to Multiple Choice and True/False types of questions, others to other question types. See Quiz Statistics for a reference of these statistics.

### A QuizStatistics object looks like:

``` example
{
  // The ID of the quiz statistics report.
  "id": 1,
  // The ID of the Quiz the statistics report is for.
  // NOTE: AVAILABLE ONLY IN NON-JSON-API REQUESTS.
  "quiz_id": 2,
  // Whether there are any students that have made mutliple submissions for this
  // quiz.
  "multiple_attempts_exist": true,
  // In the presence of multiple attempts, this field describes whether the
  // statistics describe all the submission attempts and not only the latest ones.
  "includes_all_versions": true,
  // The time at which the statistics were generated, which is usually after the
  // occurrence of a quiz event, like a student submitting it.
  "generated_at": "2013-01-23T23:59:00-07:00",
  // The API HTTP/HTTPS URL to this quiz statistics.
  "url": "http://canvas.example.edu/api/v1/courses/1/quizzes/2/statistics",
  // The HTTP/HTTPS URL to the page where the statistics can be seen visually.
  "html_url": "http://canvas.example.edu/courses/1/quizzes/2/statistics",
  // Question-specific statistics for each question and its answers.
  "question_statistics": null,
  // Question-specific statistics for each question and its answers.
  "submission_statistics": null,
  // JSON-API construct that contains links to media related to this quiz
  // statistics object.
  // NOTE: AVAILABLE ONLY IN JSON-API REQUESTS.
  "links": null
}
```

### A QuizStatisticsLinks object looks like:

``` example
// Links to media related to QuizStatistics.
{
  // HTTP/HTTPS API URL to the quiz this statistics describe.
  "quiz": "http://canvas.example.edu/api/v1/courses/1/quizzes/2"
}
```

### A QuizStatisticsQuestionStatistics object looks like:

``` example
// Statistics for submissions made to a specific quiz question.
{
  // Number of students who have provided an answer to this question. Blank or
  // empty responses are not counted.
  "responses": 3,
  // Statistics related to each individual pre-defined answer.
  "answers": null
}
```

### A QuizStatisticsAnswerStatistics object looks like:

``` example
// Statistics for a specific pre-defined answer in a Multiple-Choice or
// True/False quiz question.
{
  // ID of the answer.
  "id": 3866,
  // The text attached to the answer.
  "text": "Blue.",
  // An integer to determine correctness of the answer. Incorrect answers should
  // be 0, correct answers should 100
  "weight": 100,
  // Number of students who have chosen this answer.
  "responses": 2
}
```

### A QuizStatisticsAnswerPointBiserial object looks like:

``` example
// A point-biserial construct for a single pre-defined answer in a
// Multiple-Choice or True/False question.
{
  // ID of the answer the point biserial is for.
  "answer_id": 3866,
  // The point biserial value for this answer. Value ranges between -1 and 1.
  "point_biserial": -0.802955068546966,
  // Convenience attribute that denotes whether this is the correct answer as
  // opposed to being a distractor. This is mutually exclusive with the
  // `distractor` value
  "correct": true,
  // Convenience attribute that denotes whether this is a distractor answer and
  // not the correct one. This is mutually exclusive with the `correct` value
  "distractor": false
}
```

### A QuizStatisticsSubmissionStatistics object looks like:

``` example
// Generic statistics for all submissions for a quiz.
{
  // The number of students who have taken the quiz.
  "unique_count": 3,
  // The mean of the student submission scores.
  "score_average": 4.33333333333333,
  // The highest submission score.

  // The lowest submission score.
  "score_low": 3,
  // Standard deviation of the submission scores.
  "score_stdev": 1.24721912892465,
  // A percentile distribution of the student scores, each key is the percentile
  // (ranges between 0 and 100%) while the value is the number of students who
  // received that score.
  "scores": {"50":1,"34":5,"100":1},
  // The mean of the number of questions answered correctly by each student.
  "correct_count_average": 3.66666666666667,

}
```
