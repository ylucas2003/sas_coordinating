# LTI Resource Links API

API that exposes LTI Resource Links for viewing and editing. LTI Resource Links are artifacts created by the LTI 1.3 Deep Linking process, where a user selects a content item that is returned to Canvas for future launches.

Resource Links can be associated with Assignments, Module Items, Collaborations, and Rich Content embeddings.

Use of this API requires the `manage_lti_add` and `manage_assignments_add` permissions.

**Caution!** Resource Links are usually managed by the tool that created them via LTI Deep Linking, and using this API to create or modify links may result in errors when launching the link.

Common patterns for using this API include:

- facilitating migration between two different versions of the same tool by updating the domain of the launch URL
- creating new links to embed in rich content in Canvas
- responding to a course copy or other Canvas content migration by updating the launch URL

### A Lti::ResourceLink object looks like:

``` example
{
  // The Canvas identifier for the LTI Resource Link.
  "id": 1,
  // The Canvas identifier for the context that the LTI Resource Link is
  // associated with.
  "context_id": 1,
  // The type of the context that the LTI Resource Link is associated with.
  "context_type": "Course",
  // The Canvas identifier for the LTI 1.3 External Tool that the LTI Resource
  // Link was originally installed from. Note that this tool may have been deleted
  // or reinstalled and may not be the tool that would be launched for this url.

  // The type of Canvas content for the resource link. Included for convenience.

|----|----|----|----|
| url | Required | string | The launch URL for this resource link. |
| title |  | string | The title of the resource link. |
| custom |  | Hash | Custom parameters to be sent to the tool when launching this link. |

Links created using this API cannot be associated with a specific piece of Canvas content, like an Assignment, Module Item, or Collaboration. Links created using this API are only suitable for embedding in rich content using the ‘canvas_launch_url\` provided in the API response.

Each link will be associated with the ContextExternalTool available in this context that matches the provided url. If a matching tool is not found, or any parameters are invalid, no links will be created and this will return an error.

#### Request Parameters:

| Parameter |  | Type | Description |
|----|----|----|----|
| POST |  | string | body \[Required, Array\] The POST body should be a JSON array of objects containing the parameters for each link to create. |
